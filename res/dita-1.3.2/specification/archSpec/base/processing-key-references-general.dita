    <title>Processing key references</title>
    <shortdesc>Key references can resolve as links, as text, or as both. Within a map, they also can
        be used to create or supplement information on a topic reference. This topic covers
        information that is common to all key processing, regardless of how the key is
        used.</shortdesc>

                attributes. There is no special processing associated with either the

            <p >The effective key definitions for a key space might be affected by
                conditional processing (filtering). Processors <term outputclass="RFC-2119"
                    >SHOULD</term> perform conditional processing before
                determining the effective key definitions. However, processors might determine
                effective key definitions before filtering. Consequently, different processors might
                produce different effective bindings for the same map when there are key definitions
                that might be filtered out based on their filtering attributes.</p>
            <note >In order to retain backwards compatibility with DITA 1.0 and 1.1,
                the specification does not mandate a processing order for different DITA features.
                This makes it technically possible to determine an effective key definition, resolve
                references to that key definition, and then filter out the definition. However, the
                preferred approach is to take conditional processing into account when resolving
                keys, so that key definitions which are excluded by processing are not used in
                resolving key references.</note>

            <p>If a topic that contains key references is reused in multiple key scopes within a
                given root map such that its references resolve differently <ph

                resolved output for each distinct set of effective key definitions that are
                referenced by the topic. In such cases, authors can use the <xmlatt>copy-to</xmlatt>
                attribute <ph >to specify different source URIs for each reference to
                    a topic.</ph></p>

            <p >If a referencing element contains a key reference with an undefined
                key, it is processed as if there were no key reference, and the value of the
                    <xmlatt>href</xmlatt> attribute is used as the reference. If the
                    <xmlatt>href</xmlatt> attribute is not specified, the element is not treated as
                a navigation link. If it is an error for the element to be empty, an implementation
                    <term outputclass="RFC-2119">MAY</term> give an error message;
                it also <term outputclass="RFC-2119">MAY</term> recover from this
                error condition by leaving the key reference element empty.</p>
