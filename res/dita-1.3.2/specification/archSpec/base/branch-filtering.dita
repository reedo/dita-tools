  <title>Branch filtering</title>
  <shortdesc >The branch filtering mechanism enables map authors to set
    filtering conditions for specific branches of a map. This makes it possible for multiple
    conditional-processing profiles to be applied within a <ph >single</ph>
    publication.</shortdesc>
  <conbody>
    <p ><ph >Without the branch filtering mechanism, the
        conditions specified in a DITAVAL document are applied globally. With branch filtering, the
          <xmlelement>ditavalref</xmlelement> element specifies a DITAVAL document that can be
        applied to a subset of content; the location of the <xmlelement>ditavalref</xmlelement>
        element determines the content to which filtering conditions are applied.</ph> The filtering
      conditions then are used to filter the map branch itself (map elements used to create the
      branch), as well as the local maps or topics that are referenced by that branch.</p>
    <p >The <xmlelement>ditavalref</xmlelement> element also provides the
      ability to process a single branch of content multiple times, applying unique conditions to
      each instance of the branch. </p>
    <!--<p>DITAVAL documents specify a set of conditions that can be used to conditionally process DITA content. While these conditions are often stored outside of the content and applied globally by a processor, the <xmlelement>ditavalref</xmlelement> element can reference a DITAVAL document in order to specify a conditional-processing profile. The DITAVAL document can apply to an entire root map, or it can be applied to a submap or map branch. In addition, multiple <xmlelement>ditavalref</xmlelement> elements can be applied; this provides the ability to process a single branch of content multiple times, applying a unique set of conditions each time the branch is processed.</p>-->
