        <p><term>Controlled values</term> are keywords that can be used as values for attributes.
            For example, the <xmlatt>audience</xmlatt> attribute can take a value that identifies
            the users that are associated with a particular product. Typical values for a
            medical-equipment product line might include "therapist", "oncologist", "physicist", and
            "radiologist". In a subject scheme map, an information architect can define a list of
            these values for the <xmlatt>audience</xmlatt> attribute. Controlled values can be used
            to classify content for filtering and flagging at build time. </p>
        <p ><term>Subject definitions</term> are classifications and
            sub-classifications that compose a tree. Subject definitions provide  semantics that can
            be used in conjunction with taxonomies and ontologies. In conjunction with the
            classification domain, subject definitions can be used for retrieval and traversal of
            the content at run time when used with information viewing applications that provide
            such functionality.</p>
        <p >Key references to controlled values are resolved to a key
            definition using the same precedence rules as apply to any other key. However, once a
            key is resolved to a controlled value, that key reference does not typically result in
            links or generated text.</p>
