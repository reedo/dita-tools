  <title>Example: How key scopes affect key precedence</title>

  <conbody>
    <p>Within a single key scope, key precedence is determined by which key definition comes first
      in the map, or by the depth of the submap that defines the key. This was true for all key
      definitions prior to DITA 1.3, because all key definitions were implicitly in the same key
      scope. Scope-qualified key names differ in that precedence is determined by the location where
      the key scope is defined.</p>
    <p>This distinction is particularly important when key names or key scope names contain periods.
      While avoiding periods within these names will avoid this sort of issue, such names are legal
      so processors will need to handle them properly.</p>
    <p>The following root map contains one submap and one key definition. The submap defines a key
      named "sample".</p>

  &lt;!-- The following mapref defines the key scope "scopeName" -->
  &lt;mapref href="submap.ditamap" keyscope="scopeName"/>

  &lt;!-- The following keydef defines the key "scopeName.sample" -->

    <p>When determining precedence, all keys from the key scope "scopeName" occur at the location of
      the scope-defining element -- in this case, the <xmlelement>mapref</xmlelement> element in the
      root map. Because the <xmlelement>mapref</xmlelement> comes first in the root map, the
      scope-qualified key name "scopeName.sample" that is pulled from
        <filepath>submap.ditamap</filepath> occurs before the definition of "scopeName.sample" in
      the root map. This means that in the context of the root map, the effective definition of
      "scopeName.sample" is the scope-qualified key definition that references
        <filepath>winning-key.dita</filepath>.</p>
    <p>The following illustration shows a root map and several submaps. Each submap defines a new
      key scope, and each map defines a key. In order to aid understanding, this sample does not use
      valid DITA markup; instead, it shows the content of submaps inline where they are
      referenced.</p>

      <li>Finally, the root map defines the key "scopeA.scopeB.MYKEY".</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Because scope-qualified key definitions are considered to occur at the location of the
      scope-defining element, the effective key definition is the one from
