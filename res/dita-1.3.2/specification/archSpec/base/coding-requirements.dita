 <title>Coding practices for DITA grammar files</title>
 <shortdesc>This section collects all of the rules for creating modular DTD, RELAX NG, or XML Schema
  grammar files to represent DITA document types, specializations, and constraints.</shortdesc>
 <!--<conbody><draft-comment author="robander" time="16 February 2015">For the "specialization" sections - should make sure the shortdescs for nested topics are consistent. 2 use "implementation (coding) requirements" and one uses "coding requirements". Also, I don't think this ensures backwards compatibility, at least with regards to non-OASIS specializations, or am I missing something?</draft-comment></conbody>-->
