  <title>Equivalence of document-type shells</title>
  <shortdesc>Two distinct DITA document types that are taken from different tools or environments
    might be functionally equivalent.</shortdesc>
  <conbody>
    <p>A DITA document type is defined by the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The set of modules that are declared in the <xmlatt>domains</xmlatt> attribute on the root
        element of the document</li>
      <li>The values of the <xmlatt>class</xmlatt> attributes of all the elements in the
        document</li>
      <li>Rules for topic nesting</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Two document-type shells define the same DITA document type if they integrate identical
      vocabulary modules, constraint modules, and rules for topic nesting. For example, a document
      type shell that is an unmodified copy of the OASIS-provided  document-type shell for topic
      defines the same DITA document type as the original document-type shell. However, the new
      document-type shell has the following differences:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It is a distinct file that is stored in a different location.</li>
      <li>It has a distinct system identifier.</li>
      <li>If it has a public identifier, the public identifier is unique.</li>
    </ul>
    <note>The public or system identifier that is associated with a given document-type shell is
      not, by itself, necessarily distinguishing. <ph >This is because two different
        people or groups might use the same modules and constraints to assemble equivalent document
        type shells, while giving them different names or public identifiers.</ph>
