  <title>Conformance of document-type shells</title>
  <shortdesc>DITA documents typically are governed by a conforming DITA document-type shell.
    However, the conformance of a DITA document is a function of the document instance, not its
    governing grammar. Conforming DITA documents are not required to use a conforming document-type
    shell.</shortdesc>

    <p><ph >Conforming DITA documents are not required to have any governing document
        type declaration or schema.</ph> There might be compelling or practical reasons to use
      non-conforming document-type shells. For example, a document might use a document-type shell
      that does not conform to the DITA requirements for shells in order to meet the needs of a
      specific application or tool. Such a non-conforming document-type shell still might enable the
      creation of conforming DITA content.</p>
