<title>Delayed conref resolution elements</title>
<shortdesc>The delayed conref resolution domain provides several elements for use when using DITA in
  situations that enable delayed or delivery time resolution of conref. The elements allow users to
  resolve some conref values statically, while delaying others for later resolution.</shortdesc>

<p id="export-anchors-disclaimer">Many publishing systems for which DITA is used as a source format
do not have a way to dynamically resolve content references; those systems will not see any benefit
from this domain. When DITA is used for those systems, behaviors related to this domain should be
ignored.</p>
