 <title>About the specification source</title>
 <shortdesc >The DITA specification is authored <ph >in
   DITA</ph>. It is a complex document that uses many DITA features, including key references
  (keyrefs), content references (conrefs), and controlled values set in a subject scheme
  map.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>As a convenience for readers, the DITA specification is published in several packages <ph
    >that</ph> contain different combinations of required and optional modules.
   The ability to easily define, manage, and publish these packages is a result of using DITA for
   the specification source. The source files for the DITA specification are managed in a version
   control repository that is maintained by OASIS; they also can be downloaded from OASIS.</p>
  <p >The DITA Technical Committee used the following applications to work
   with the DITA source:</p>
  <ul >
   <li>DITA Open Toolkit</li>
   <li >&lt;oXygen/> XML Editor, <ph >XMetaL</ph> Author
    Enterprise, and Arbortext Editor</li>
   <li>DITAweb</li>
   <li>Antenna House Formatter</li>
  </ul>
